#### Neuromorphic Computational Imaging: An Event-Driven Optical Method to Recover Dynamic Objects Obscured by Turbid Media

Abstract: In this paper a new optical-computational method is introduced to unveil images of targets whose visibility is severely obscured by light scattering in dense, turbid media. Here, the targets of interest are taken to be dynamic in that their optical properties are time-varying whether stationary in space or moving. The scheme, to our knowledge the first of its kind, is human vision inspired whereby diffuse photons collected from the turbid medium are first transformed to spike trains by an event sensing camera (DVS) as in the retina, and image reconstruction is then performed by a neuromorphic computing approach mimicking the brain. We combine benchtop experimental data with support from physics-based simulations to develop the neuromorphic computational model and apply this for image reconstruction of different MNIST character and image sets by a dedicated deep spiking neural network (SNN) algorithm under conditions of turbidity where an original image is unintelligible to the human eye or a digital video camera.
